# Random Password Generator

## Description

My motivation to create this app was to continue to learn and impliment the javascript elements that I have learned so far in the bootcamp.
I was given the HTML and CSS codes for the page.  I was also supplied with a starter javascript text to build from.  
I built off of that starter code to work towards completing this user story:

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This website can be visited by a user that wants to generate a random password.  The user will click the "generate password" button and be prompted with a series of parameters that they do or do not want included in their password.
After recieving the input from the user, the app will generate a password based off of those inputs and display it for the user
